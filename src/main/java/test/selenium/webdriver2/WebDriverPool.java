/**
 * An utility that helps to create, reuse and dismiss WebDriver instances.
 *
 * The WebDriver instances created by the pool and stored in the pool are called "managed instances".
 *
 * There are three ways to manage instances, three classes that implement WebDriverPool interface:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link SingleWebDriverPool} allows a single managed instance of WebDriver to exist at any given moment,</li>
 * <li>{@link ThreadLocalSingleWebDriverPool} allows a single managed instance of WebDriver to exist for each thread,</li>
 * <li>{@link LooseWebDriverPool} does not impose any restrictions, it creates a new managed instance on each request</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * See documentation at https://github.com/barancev/webdriver-factory/
 * See usage examples at https://github.com/barancev/webdriver-factory-samples/
